#A 3D printer is a machine that takes a computer generated model and prints it in 3D. It does this by taking feeding plastic to 
#an extruder that melts it and deposits it in layers to create the 3D model. The following text will be displayed on a built in
#screen to help a user properly utlize their printer. 

#Do not remove '\n' from the text. It means a new line on the screen.
#Only translate text that is between quotation marks ("").
